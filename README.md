This is my project 1. 

The project purpose was to create an hotel reservation system. Where a guest of the hotel can do login in the web app and be able to do
common things like update his profile, create issues, read and reply to his message, and most of all be able to book a room.
The host of the hotel is the hotel manager or supervisor who is able to view guests requests, and be able to market the rooms to guests.

My project started at a login screen where the host as well as the guest can login. Once they log in they will be forwarded to their session/dashboard
At their respectif dashboard the can view options available for them. 

The project had a big learning curve for me. I had to figure out how to create a session based login; it took me a while. When
i figured it out i had issue with the data being input by the user not being populated or persisted to the databases table.I also had null 
values in some column. Once i figured out what was the problem; i had to deal with the front end. I need a good user interface but 
i had a little or no practical knowlege on HTML or Css or Javascript. That is where i pretty much stop on my project. 
When i refactor i will redo the session based login, where i don't have a fixed host or user in the database. By the way in case you want to run
the application the host's username is amadou3 with 23456 as password and the guest is logger with 34567 as a password.
Also when refactoring i will retouch my front end with user interaction using javascript, ajax and work on only one front end framework.
I had put all the effort on the back end that i realized that i could have taken the load off from the back end by using some front
end technologies.

It was a big learning curve and still learning.
